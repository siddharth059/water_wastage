        <h3>together we can save the water</h3>
        <p>"In a world where life thrives on water, water conservation is not just an option but a necessity. As we grapple with the growing challenges of water scarcity and environmental degradation, it is imperative that we take conscious steps to reduce water wastage and preserve this precious resource for future generations.."</p>
        <p>Water waste is just one example of a damaging environmental factor, but it's an extremely significant one. It's very important for individuals, households and businesses alike to understand the impact of water waste on the environment so that the world at large can work to a more sustainable future..</p>
        <p>water wastage play a crucial role in our environment and society. Here are some important aspects of water wastage:

          <br> <br>1 <b>Environmental damage:</b> Water is essential for life, and ecosystems can be severely damaged when water is scarce. Wasting water can lead to the depletion of wetlands, rivers, and lakes, and can also harm the plants and animals that depend on these ecosystems.
            
         <br> <br> 2 <b>Water scarcity:</b> Water is a finite resource, and as the global population grows and the climate changes, water scarcity is becoming a major concern. Wasting water now makes it more difficult to ensure that there will be enough water to meet the needs of future generations.
            
         <br> <br>3 <b>Economic costs:</b> Wasting water can also have significant economic costs. The treatment and distribution of water requires energy and resources, and wasted water is essentially money down the drain. Additionally, water scarcity can lead to higher prices for water and other goods and services.
            
         <br> <br>4 <b>Social impacts:</b><br>

         1. Health problems: Water wastage can lead to a number of health problems, including waterborne diseases, malnutrition, and heatstroke.<br>
         2. Reduced access to education and employment opportunities: Water wastage can also reduce access to education and employment opportunities. This is because water is essential for basic hygiene, sanitation, and agriculture.<br>
         3.Conflict: Water scarcity can also lead to conflict between different groups of people who are competing for access to this limited resource.

            When considering the situation of water wastage and the earth's future, it's important to take into account daily
            water use and habits within other countries around the world. With these statistics, you can better understand how 
            your own country (and therefore your own effort) is faring in comparison to other countries.
            
            These statistics can show a shocking difference between water use statistics based on different countries.
            This is an important reminder of how all countries across the world need to work cohesively to lower water
            wastage and help save the environment. We're all living on the same planet, after all.
            
            Below are the statistics of daily water used on average by individuals in liters in each country.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">India is the largest user of groundwater in the world. The country extracts more groundwater than China and US combined. Groundwater meets more than half of the total clean water requirement in the country.230 km3 of groundwater is used which is a quarter of the global total. India contains 690 km3 and 396 km3 of annual utilizable surface water and groundwater resources respectively. Groundwater forms the largest share of India’s agriculture and drinking water supply.89 %, 9 % and 2 % groundwater is used in agriculture, household and industry respectively. The groundwater levels reduced by 61 % between 2007 and 2017.</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Rising population, rapid urbanization, industrialization and inadequate rainfall are responsible for this. According to Government norms, rural households, towns without sewerage, cities with sewers and megacities with sewers are supposed to use 55 L per capita per day (lpcd), 70 lpcd, 135 lpcd and 150 lpcd respectively. </p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify; "><b>Out of the total water requirement per person per day, 30 % is wasted. 27 % of the water is utilized for bathing and toilet use. Not turning off the tap while brushing our teeth or shaving, leakages in many spaces, washing vehicles with fresh water are some of the major areas where water is wasted.</b></p>
